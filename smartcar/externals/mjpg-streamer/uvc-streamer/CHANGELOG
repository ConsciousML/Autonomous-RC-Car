VERSION 1.3:
- Two great contributions for uvc_streamer by
  Lucas van Staden (lvs) and Alan W. Richter (awr)
- (lvs) Added control.c and control.h for camera motion control (view control.c
  for instructions)
- (lvs) Moved some variables used in uvc_stream.c to a struct to allow sharing
  between threads
- (awr) cleaning up the opened socket on shutdown, added high resolution

VERSION 1.2:
- removed obsolete jpeg decoder source from "utils.c".
- changed occurences of (FILE *) to use (int) UNIX filedescriptors.
- added the subpage "snapshot". It's possible to get a single JPEG now.
  Just use an URL like "http://127.0.0.1:8080/snapshot" to get a single
  frame.

VERSION 1.1:
- Replaced the classic reader/writer IPC solution with a pthread broadcast
  condition. This should improve timing for higher framerates.
