"uvc_stream" is a command line application to stream JPEG files over an
IP-based network from the webcam to a viewer like Firefox, Cambozola, 
Videolanclient or even to a Windows Mobile device running the TCPMP-Player.

It was written for embedded devices with very limited ressources in terms of 
RAM and CPU. The decision for Linux-UVC was done, because supported cameras
directly produce JPEG-data, allowing fast and perfomant M-JPEG streams even
from an embedded device running OpenWRT.

For example a VGA resolution video stream with 5 frames per second produces
about 2-15% CPU load of the 200MHz Mips processor of the Asus WL500gP router.
Also RAM usage is quite low.

I would suggest not to open this server to the internet. Use it as input to 
the programm "motion" [http://motion.sf.net] running at your DMZ instead.
Motion has many users and i expect it to be checked more often for security
issues. Keep in mind, that motions advanced capabilties like
motion-detection, writing of avifiles etc require more ressources. 

In contrast to the better known SPCA5XX-LE, UVC-cameras in average produce
better image quality (See Michel XHaards comparison table and rating at 
his site) [http://mxhaard.free.fr/embedded.html].

This programm was written in 2007 by Tom Stoeveken, basing on luvcview. 
The luvcview sources were modified using the tool "indent" and afterwards
SDL dependencies were removed to reduce dependencies to other packages.

This tool can be modified and distributed according to the terms of the GPL v2.

Currently no issues are known, but since this software is quite young and not
used widely it may cause problems. You must really know what you are doing, if
you use this software. If you want to use the software you are obliged to check
if the sourcecode does what you expect it to do and take the risk yourself to
use it.
