### Html server
----------
This app is built based on Django.

Control the Smart Video Car via the gravity sensor on a cell phone - control the car and the camera onside, as well as view the camera video in real time. What's more, on the app, you can conveniently calibrate the car turning and the pan-tilt. 

This server runs on Raspberry Pi, and is controlled by the Android app.

Download the app from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appinventor.ai_cavonxx.SunFounder_Smart_Video_Car)

####Setup:
1. Install Django:

	sudo pip install django
2. Then, at `Sunfounder_Smart_Video_Car_Kit_for_RaspberryPi/http_server/` run:

	sudo python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

3. Open the app on your phone, and type in your Raspberry Pi's IP address, click FORWARD (the right arrow) and then you can see the image from the car's camera.

####Calibration:
Begin calibration by clicking on the dot in a circle at the corner. Note: the calibration steps are quite small. For convenience, you can click more times or even type in a specific value.

####Control:
 - Control the car direction by tilting your phone, like a steering wheel.
 - Control the car forward/backward by the up/down arrow on the left.
 - Control the camera pan/tilt by the up/down/left/right arrow on the right, and set the camera back to the default position by the middle dot.
 - Change the motor speed by the bar under the camera view

####App:
The Android app is build under [MIT App Inventor 2](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/), so no detail source code, just a project folder, which you can edit it with App Inventor 2. The project files is under Android_App folder.
